    "\n",
    "* I have been analysing several metagenomic dataset for quite some time and I wish to organise all the scripts, tips and tricks I have learned from these studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So I decied to put the notes into jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Some notebooks are python based and some are R. \n",
    "\n",
    "* So next time when I use it or some one else just copy paste all the scripts from these notebooks and start again.\n",

    "* Notebooks discribing the pipelines.\n",
    "* Scripts I made and others to build up the entire workflow.\n",
    "* A galaxy work flow I created for LEfSe analysis.\n",
    "* Notebooks contain information about the softwares and Packages I used, some tips to do things in commandline etc.\n",
