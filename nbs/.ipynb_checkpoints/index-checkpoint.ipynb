    "#### Rationale behind doing Functional Profiling of 16s amplicon data\n",
    "\n",
    "* 16s region is pretty small and it compise less than 0.1 % of the total fraction of the entire bacterial genome.\n",
    "* 16s sequencing of the samples is a comparatively inexpensive\n",
    "* So 16s metagenomic data give us the idea of what kind of bugs are there in the sample.\n",
    "* Now the question is how do we find out what these bugs are doing in that sample. \n",
    "* To find out about these possible fuctions of these bugs I use PICRUSt.\n",
    "* PICRUSt is thus an extrapolation of the 16s data. \n",

    "#### Rationale behind making this ipython notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "* I have been analysing several metagenomic dataset for quite some time and I wish to organise all the scripts, tips and tricks I have learned from these studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So I decied to put the notes into jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Some notebooks are python based and some are R. \n",
    "\n",
    "* So next time when I use it or some one else just copy paste all the scripts from these notebooks and start again.\n",

    "* A galaxy work flow I created for LEfSe analysis.\n",
    "* Notebooks contain information about the softwares and Packages I used, some tips to do things in commandline etc.\n",
